Demo Pi

The Pi-4 used for demo has four sensors then the Pi's used in the training.
The Pi-11 till Pi-16 in the training have only a Groove high accuracy temperature sensor. Whereas the Pi-4
has next to the 2 i2c high accuracy temp sensor (two digits) also a very simple temperature sensor (zero digit) and
an air quality sensor.

The Demo Pi software differentiates for the Pi software as it reports more values in OPC-server
and show more in the client version.

Hardware configuration of Pi-4:

Pi 3 Model B (but any Model B would do)

Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi
Grove high accuracy temperature sensors on I2C ports (but also read Network & hard../README grove multiple I2C ..
Grove temperature sensor on port A2
Grove air quality sensor v1.3 on port A6
3 x Grove LED button on D5, D16 and D18 ports of the Base Hat (input button, output LED)
3 x Grove Relay on D22, D24 and D26 (outputs)

if you want to run it from command prompt, make sure you converted with dos2unix the line with the shebang
#!/usr/bin/python3

1- and 2- are demo of Grove use only, with 1- only in terminal command line mode, physicals button works, but not screen
and where 2- show the dashboard such that button physical and on screen works.

3- OPC server
normally the Pi-4 is wired on the shielded smart-factory 192.168.0.0/24, 192-network at IP nr 192.168.0.4
on the 10.0.0.0/24 smart-engineering network, the Pi-4 can have a DHCP address (any addresses), but we prefer 10.0.0.4.

demo 4 is a PC running the OPC client and  demo 3 runs on the Pi-4 the OPC server.
Both need to be wired to the router with an Ethernet cable

demo 5, the PC OPC client now runs in the 10-net, outside the shielded smart-factory network.
Pi-4 must be on 192.168.0.0/24 smart-factory network at 192.168.0.4 wired and shielded by the router/firewall
where the firewall dstnat (destination NAT) filter rules has to be hard programmed,
the Pi-4 needs to have the IP nr 192.168.0.4 where OPC will be on port 4840 (part of the hard programmed dstnat rule)
and demo 5 is run on a PC in the 10net smart-engineering addressing the WAN side of the router/firewall at 10.0.0.254
The dstnat setting to access the Pi-4 on port 4840 is 10.0.0.254:54844 (5 + 4840 + 4)
