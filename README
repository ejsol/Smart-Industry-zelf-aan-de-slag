
These are the files belonging to the Zelf-aan-de-Slag data & cyber security Smart Industry workshop
SIZAS = Smart Industry Zelf Aan de Slag, or in English Smart Industry - Do It Yourself (SIDIY)

At top level there is the PDF with the presentation and the two participants instruction documents with all the needed
settings for the RevPi and the Pi sessions. Available upon request as github does not support such files.
There is a third document describing the hack cases. That document is not generally available.

In the Pi directory you find the example code for using the PI as an I/O device and OPC-server.
For the OPC application you need to computers, on the 10.0.0.4 server (the Pi with th Seeed Grove I/O) and a client
running on your own computer, but here with this coding running on a client Pi at 10.0.0.5. As the participant Pi with
the I/O and server will be numbered 10.0.0.11-16, you need to adapt the source code here to those server IP numbers.

In the RevPi directory you find the example code to run on a RevPi (10.0.0.2 (Core 1 type) or 10.0.0.3 (Core 3 RevPi)).
You start the first two programs on the RevPi using a terminal/mouse/keyboard connect to it. The third, fourth and fifth
example you run from you own PC using RevPi Python Control program (revpipycontrol.exe) and after connecting to the RevPi.
These programs and the sixth program with MQTT requires that the RevPi runs the revpimodio2 service from revpimodio.org.
(if not,then on pi@RevPi:$ sudo service revpipyload start)
The sixth RevPi (python) example program requires you to run it from your own PC, running in the same IP subnet
(10.0.0.0/24) as the RevPi. This program runs a dashboard on your PC to control the RevPi I/O. There should be no other
program running on the RevPi controlling the same I/O (i.e. you should stop the running program from revpipycontrol.exe)

Finally, you can start on the 10.0.0.4 also Node-Red with pi@Pi-4:$ node-red-start. It will start in a terminal box,
and once running you can open the webbrowser at localhost:1880, have the revpi.json loaded, and open an second webwindow
using localhost:1880/ui to see the dashboard (optionally after selecting at the localhost:1880 screen the deploy button)
Stop node-red by opening an extra terminal window and type $ node-red-stop.
