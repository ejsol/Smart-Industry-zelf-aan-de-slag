
These are the files belonging to the Zelf-aan-de-Slag data & cyber security Smart Industry workshop
SIZAS = Smart Industry Zelf Aan de Slag, or in English Smart Industry - Do It Yourself (SIDIY)

At top level there is the PDF with the presentation and the two participants instruction documents with all the needed
settings for the RevPi and the Pi sessions. Available upon request as github does not support such files.
There is a third document describing the hack cases. That document is not generally available.

In the Pi directory you find the example code for using the PI as an I/O device and OPC-server.
For the OPC application you need two computers, on 10.0.0.4 the server (the Pi with the Seeed Grove I/O) and in the same 
10.0.0.0/24 network a client running on your own computer. As the participant Pi with the I/O and server will be numbered 
10.0.0.11-16, you need to adapt in the source code the 10.0.0.4 to your 10.0.0.1x IP numbers of your server/Seeed-grove Pi.

In the RevPi directory you find the example code to run on a RevPi (10.0.0.2 (Core 1 type) or 10.0.0.3 (Core 3 RevPi)).
You start the first two programs on the RevPi using a terminal/mouse/keyboard connect to it. The third, fourth and fifth
example you run from you own PC using RevPi Python Control program (revpipycontrol.exe) and after connecting to the RevPi.
These programs requires that the RevPi runs the revpimodio2 service from revpimodio.org, if not,then on pi@RevPi:$ sudo service revpipyload start)
The sixth RevPi (python) example program requires you to run it from your own PC, running in the same IP subnet
(10.0.0.0/24) as the RevPi. This program runs a dashboard on your PC to control the RevPi I/O. There should be no other
program running on the RevPi controlling the same I/O (i.e. you should stop the running program from revpipycontrol.exe). 
Program 7 is with OPC server software in your PLC program and a client in the same smart-factory 192.168.0.0/24 network or 
with a client in the 10.0.0.0/24 network and acces to the firewall of the 192.168.0.0/24 network. 

Finally, you can start on the 10.0.0.4 also Node-Red with pi@Pi-4:$ node-red-start. It will start in a terminal box,
and once running you can open the webbrowser at localhost:1880, have the revpi.json loaded, and open an second webwindow
using localhost:1880/ui to see the dashboard (optionally after selecting at the localhost:1880 screen the deploy button)
Stop node-red by opening an extra terminal window and type $ node-red-stop.
