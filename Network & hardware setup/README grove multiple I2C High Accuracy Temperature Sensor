sample code comment

The standard seeedstudio library from http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C_High_Accuracy_Temperature_Sensor-MCP9808/
(grove.py) only allows one I2C senson on address 0x18. To use multiple sensors several changes are needed.

# using the multiple I2C high accuracy temperature sensors
# 000 = 0x18
# 001 = 0x19
# 010 = 0x1A
# 100 = 0x1C
...

    #     temperature = Factory.getTemper("MCP9808-I2C")
    # this is the standard call, but adding more I2C high-acc temp sensors requires soldering them (see website above)
    # and modification of the call to e.g.
    #      temperature = Factory.getTemper("MCP9808-I2C", 0x18)
    # and modifying two files in the standard Seeed-Studio library modules Factory.getTemper & TemperMCP9808
    # using sudo nano (it are library files):
    #
    # in /usr/local/lib/Python3.7/dist_packages/grove/factory/factory.py change getTemper from
    #    def getTemper(self, typ, channel = None):   ==> def     def getTemper(self, typ, channel = None, addr = 0x18):
    # ...
    #       elif typ == "MCP9808-I2C":
    #             return TemperMCP9808(addr)
    #
    # and in ../lib/Python3.7/site_package/grove/factory/temperature/mcp9808.py change TemperMCP9808 from
    # class TemperMCP9808(Temper):       into    class TemperMCP9808(Temper)
    #     def __init__(self):                       def __init__(self, addr):
    #         self.mcp = MCP9808(I2C.MRAA_I2C)          self.mcp = MCP9808(I2C.MRAA_I2C, addr)
    #
    # the final upm.pyupm_mcp9808 is standard prepared for address selection
    #

Both modified files are in this Github
