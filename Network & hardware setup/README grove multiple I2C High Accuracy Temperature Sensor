sample code comment

The standard Seeed-studio library from http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-I2C_High_Accuracy_Temperature_Sensor-MCP9808/
(grove.py) only allows one I2C sensor on address 0x18. To use multiple sensors several changes are needed.

# using the multiple I2C high accuracy temperature sensors
# 000 = 0x18
# 001 = 0x19
# 010 = 0x1A
# 100 = 0x1C
...



#     temperature = Factory.getTemper("MCP9808-I2C")
# this is the standard call, but adding more I2C high-acc temp sensors requires soldering them (see website above)
# and modification of the call to e.g.
#      temperature = Factory.getTemper("MCP9808-I2C", 0x18)
# and modifying two files in the standard Seeed-Studio library modules Factory.getTemper & TemperMCP9808
# using sudo nano (it are library files):
#
# in /usr/local/lib/Python3.7/dist_packages/grove/factory/factory.py change getTemper from
   def getTemper(self, typ, channel = None):   ==> def     def getTemper(self, typ, channel = None, addr = 0x18):
 ...
       elif typ == "MCP9808-I2C":
             return TemperMCP9808(addr)
#
# and in ../lib/Python3.7/site_package/grove/temperature/mcp9808.py change TemperMCP9808 from
   class TemperMCP9808(Temper):       into    class TemperMCP9808(Temper)
     def __init__(self):                       def __init__(self, addr):
          self.mcp = MCP9808(I2C.MRAA_I2C)          self.mcp = MCP9808(I2C.MRAA_I2C, addr)

# the final upm.pyupm_mcp9808 is standard prepared for address selection
#
# but it might be needed to modify it too at /usr/lib/python3/dist_packages/upm/pyupm_mcp9808.py
  at def __init__(self, bus, addr=0x18) into def __init__(self, bus, addr)

# in other words remove the fixed addr


# Both modified first two files are in this Github and the third one (all all three) you need to edit with

cd /usr/local/lib/Python3.7/dist_packages/grove/factory/
sudo nano factory.py

# do the two edits of addr as describe above around line 146 and 150

cd  /usr/local/lib/Python3.7/site_package/grove/temperature/
sudo nano mcp9808.py

# do the two edits of addr as describe above  at line 41 and 42

cd /usr/lib/python3/dist_packages/upm/
sudo nano pyupm_mcp9808.py

# do the delete of =0x18 at line 137

# remark, it might be that the setting of PATH emforces that Python starts in /home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/..
# instead of /usr/local/lib/python3.7...
# in that case you need to modify the files in the .local directory.
