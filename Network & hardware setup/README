The network consists of a smart-engineering router, a Mikrotik hAP, with the 10.0.0.0/24 network
using the following addresses
10.0.0.1 hAP router (during the session the WAN port ether1 is not connected to Internet)
10.0.0.2 RevPi core 1
10.0.0.3 reserved for RevPi core 3 (this RevPi now is located in the smart-factory network at 192.168.0.3)
10.0.0.4 Pi-4 (demo Pi with 3 sensors)

10.0.0.10 Pi-10 configuration Pi
10.0.0.11-16 participants Pi's Pi-11 till Pi-16

10.0.0.20-100 DHCP

10.0.0.254 WAN port of router of the 192.168.0.0/24 smart-factory network, hEX router port 1 (ether1)

The hAP router uses the standard Mikrotik router setting (firewall, etc,) with both the 2.4Ghz and the 5Ghz Wi-Fi 1-5
activated. Next to Wi-Fi it has 1 WAN and 4 Giga Ethernet ports.

The 192.168.0.0/24 network smart-factory is shielded by a tightly locked-down router with the following configuration
192.168.0.1 hEX router (no Wi-Fi)
192.168.0.3 RevPi core 3 (Rev3)
192.168.0.4 reserved for Pi-4

192.168.0.20-100 DHCP

The hEX standard firewall rule set (RouterOS 6.45.3 model RB750Gr3) is replaced but the following setting
(copy text and enter it as script in the Mikrotik router terminal interface)
